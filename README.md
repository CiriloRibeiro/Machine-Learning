The following material is currently available:

<b>Python code</b>:

<ul>
  <li> brownian_path.py, brownian_var.py: </li>
  <li> fuzzy.py: </li>
  <li> <p style="font-family:'Courier New'">fittingCurve.py</p>, fittingEllipse.py, mixture1D.py: described in my article <em>Machine Learning Cloud Regression: The Swiss Army Knife of Optimization</em> available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2022/08/25/machine-learning-cloud-regression-the-swiss-army-knife-of-optimization/">here</a></li>
</ul>

<b>Spreadsheets</b>: 

<ul>
  <li> shapes4.xlsx: </li>
  <li> regression5.xlsx, regression5_Static.xlsx: </li>
  <li> linear2-small.xlsx: </li>
  <li>fuzzyf2.xlsx: </li>
</ul>

Eventually, the purpose is to write a new book containing the material in question as well as some future articles, and integrating the best from my previous book <em>Statistics - New Foundations, Toolbox, and Machine Learning Recipes</em> available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/resources/">here</a>.
