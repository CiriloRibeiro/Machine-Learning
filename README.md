The following material is currently available:

<b>Python code</b>:

<ul>
  <li> brownian_path.py, brownian_var.py: </li>
  <li> fuzzy.py: </li>
  <li> fittingCurve.py, fittingEllipse.py, mixture1D.py: <br>
    Described in my article <em>Machine Learning Cloud Regression: The Swiss Army Knife of Optimization</em>, available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2022/08/25/machine-learning-cloud-regression-the-swiss-army-knife-of-optimization/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<b>Spreadsheets</b>:

  <li> shapes4.xlsx: <br>
  Described in my article <em>Computer Vision: Shape Classification via Explainable AI</em>, available <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2022/04/20/computer-vision-shape-classification-via-explainable-ai/">here</a>.</li>
  <li> regression5.xlsx, regression5_Static.xlsx: </li>
  <li> linear2-small.xlsx: </li>
  <li>fuzzyf2.xlsx: </li>
