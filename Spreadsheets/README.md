This folder contains all the spreadsheets of my upcoming machine learning book. Currently, the following spreadshhets are available:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Spreadsheets/shapes4.xlsx">Shapes4.xlsx</a>: related to shape signature, matching, comparison and classification. See the related article on MLTechniques.com, <a href="https://mltechniques.com/2022/04/20/computer-vision-shape-classification-via-explainable-ai/">here</a>. A PDF version with detailed explanations, originally written in LaTeX and entitled <em>Classification of Shapes via Explainable AI</em> is available at <a href="https://mltechniques.com/resources/">MLTechniques.com/resources</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Spreadsheets/regression5.xlsx">Regression5.xlsx</a> and <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Spreadsheets/regression5_Static.xlsx">Regression5_Static.xlsx</a>: interpretable linear regression on synthetic data, respectively full spreadsheet and spreadsheet with regression coefficients and performance metrics for all the possible feature configurations. See article about it, <a href="https://mltblog.com/3KTvu5h">here</a>. The technical PDF version with detailed explanations, originally written in LaTeX and entitled <em>Interpretable Machine Learning on Synthetic Data, and Little Known Secrets About Linear Regression</em> is available at <a href="https://mltechniques.com/resources/">MLTechniques.com/resources</a>.</li>
  <li><a href="https://ln5.sync.com/dl/0caeb8e10/mztnibg9-xrkdks7g-r8bsgabw-3fsizwif">Fuzzy4.xlsz</a> is related to the fuzzy regression method. It is too large for GitHub (13 MB) and stored on Sync.com instead. The smaller spreadsheet, which corresponds to the small output file of the Python program <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Source%20Code/fuzzy.py">fuzzy.py</a>, is available <a href="https://github.com/VincentGranville/Machine-Learning/blob/main/Spreadsheets/fuzzyf2.xlsx">here</a>.
</ul>
